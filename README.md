# Contact Sales Integration Documentation

Welcome to the Contact Sales integration guide. This documentation explains how to integrate [Contact Sales](https://contactsalesai.com), an artificial intelligence powered sales liason, into your website.

## What is Contact Sales?

Contact Sales provides a virtual sales executive, Echo, that brings a new level of intelligence and personalization to your sales process. By simply CCing `echo@contactsalesai.com` on your emails, Echo intelligently summarizes, personalizes, and confirms inbound requests, ensuring that nothing slips through the cracks.

For more insight into the capabilities of Contact Sales, feel free to visit our [landing page](https://contactsalesai.com).

## How to Use Contact Sales

Incorporating Contact Sales into your workflow is straightforward. All you need to do is include Echo in your email correspondences. Here is how to do this using a 'mailto' hyperlink in HTML:

```html
<a href="mailto:sales@acme.org?cc=echo@contactsalesai.com">Contact Sales</a>
```

Simply replace `sales@acme.org` with your business email. Any time a user sends an email using this link, Echo will be automatically CCed and begin assisting with the request.
